# SQL Data Analysis Project

This repository contains SQL scripts developed as part of my practice and learning in database management, querying, and data analysis using MySQL Workbench.

 Project Overview
The project is based on a sample retail database (`sql_store`) that includes real-world entities such as:

- Customers  
- Orders  
- Order Items  
- Products  
- Shippers  

Using this data, I performed various SQL operations, including:

- Joins  
- Subqueries  
- Grouping and Aggregation  
- Window Functions  
- Date-based analysis  
- Data insights and reporting

 Files in This Repository
- sql_project_solution.sql – Contains fully written analytical SQL queries that extract insights such as:
  - Total revenue
  - Top spending customers
  - Most sold products
  - Monthly earning trends
  - State-wise performance
  - Delivery efficiency
  - Customers with no orders, etc.

Tools & Technologies
- *Database:* MySQL / SQL Store Sample Database  
- *Environment:* MySQL Workbench  
- *Query Language:* SQL

Key Skills Demonstrated
- Relational database understanding  
- Writing optimised SQL SELECT queries  
- Data summarisation and reporting  
- Window functions for running totals  
- Real analytical insights from structured data

 How to Use
1. Import or ensure the `sql_store` database exists in your MySQL instance.  
2. Open `sql_project_solution.sql` in MySQL Workbench.  
3. Run queries individually to reproduce results.
